#  React Language Switcher

This is a mini React project demonstrating the use of the `useContext` hook to manage and share global state — in this case, the selected language — across multiple components.

## Features

- Switch between English, Hindi, and Telugu
- Uses `useContext` to maintain language state globally
- Applies selected language to the welcome message and footer quote
- Saves language selection in `localStorage` for persistence
- Fully controlled `<select>` input

## Concepts Practiced

- `useContext` for global state
- `useState` and controlled components
- Modular folder structure
