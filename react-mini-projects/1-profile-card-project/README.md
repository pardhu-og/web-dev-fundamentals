#  Profile Card – React Mini Project

This is a small React project that shows profile cards using components, props, and the `useState` hook.


##  What I Learned

- Creating reusable components in React
- Passing data using `props`
- Using `props.children` to make components more flexible
- Managing state with `useState`
- Showing/hiding parts of UI using conditional rendering (`&&`)
- Looping through data using `.map()` and rendering JSX


##  Features

- Each card displays:
  - Name
  - Role
  - Background color (based on favorite color)
  - A "More Info" button to toggle description
- Data is passed through props
- Clean and modular code
