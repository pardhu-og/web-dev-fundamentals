# React Routing Practice â€“ Docs Layout Project

This is a mini project built to practice **React Router v6+** concepts, including:

- Basic routing with `<Routes>` and `<Route>`
- Nested routing using `<Outlet>`
- Layout pattern using a shared `DocsLayout` component
- Navigation with `<Link>` from `react-router-dom`
- A simple `Navbar` that links to all routes

## Pages Implemented

- About (`/about`)
- Docs Layout (`/docs`)
  - HTML Docs (`/docs/Html`)
  - CSS Docs (`/docs/CSS`)
  - JavaScript Docs (`/docs/js`)
- Not Found (`*` route for unknown URLs)

## Tools Used

- React
- React Router DOM v6+
- Vite (for faster dev server)
